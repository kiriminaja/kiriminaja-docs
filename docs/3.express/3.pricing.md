| Shipment Category                      | Formula                                     |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Regular (Including Next Day, Same Day) | ``width`` * ``length`` * ``height`` / ``6`` |
| Trucking                               | ``width`` * ``length`` * ``height`` / ``4`` |

The result of the above calculation is in grams. If the value from the above calculation is greater than the actual weight, then the calculated dimensional weight value will be sent when making a call to this endpoint page.
