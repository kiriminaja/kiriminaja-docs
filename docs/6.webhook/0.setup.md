# Preference

The callback address must have a valid A or AAAA record. We will reject any URL that is not accessible. Currently, only one callback/webhook is permitted, so please prepare and manage it carefully. We will use the POST method, and any errors in your system are your responsibility.

```shell
[POST] /api/mitra/set_callback
```

:::warning
It is recommended not to modify the callback endpoint without giving prior information.
